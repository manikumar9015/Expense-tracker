# Expense Tracker Application

A full-stack expense tracking system built with **FastAPI** for the backend and **React (Vite)** for the frontend. 
This application allows users to manage personal finances by recording and categorizing transactions, and optionally supports financial insights using a downloadable NLP model.

## Overview

This project provides an integrated solution for managing income and expenses through a web-based interface. The backend API is developed using **FastAPI**, ensuring performance and scalability, while the frontend is built using **React** with **Vite** for fast development and build processes.

A pre-trained NLP model (`finreport-model`) for generating financial summaries was originally part of the repository but has been removed due to size constraints. Instructions are provided below to download and integrate this model manually.

---

## Features

- User authentication with JWT
- CRUD operations for transactions
- Categorization of income and expenses
- Modular backend structure (routers, services, models)
- Responsive UI built with React
- RESTful API with interactive documentation
- Optional integration with a downloadable financial NLP model
